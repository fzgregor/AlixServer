# this script is take from
# http://hartvig.de/2009/howto-automatically-spin-down-external-usb-hard-drives-in-ubuntu/
# and adapted to 
# - write state to /tmp
# - support different harddrives at the same time
# - arguemtn check
# - only save one state file
# - dont use md5, just compare content
# - dont try opening not existing file
# - throw all sdparm output to /dev/null
# form the comments below the article
# - check for root
# - also support uuids to identify sdX
